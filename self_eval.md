# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

Comparison operators were the easiest out of all of the other conditionals we learned today. My only issue with them is forgetting an extra = or forgetting "" around strings.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

Logicals are also very self explanatory as we use both && and ||. Again, the only things that I need to remind myself is inputting the code correctly so that I do not get an error code.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

Though if statements were the most fun working with today, I will say these were by far the most difficult. I think the order of which if, else, and elsif statements are what will be the hardest for me.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

I spent a total of one and half hours today productively. And extra 30 minutes was spent wondering why my Terminal was not pushing everything in my VS Code into my GitHub. Again, simple coding mistakes that I hope to get over eventually.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I will practice by going onto Replit and trying different examples that are given to us on the Mod 0 on my free time. I also think doing outside research such as watching YouTube videos and reading articles on Ruby code would be helpful as well. This does not require going onto my calendar.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

No further questions. I really love working with Ruby and cannot wait to learn more on it. Also, I really enjoying the "ah-ha!" moments while I am working on errors or asking questions and seeking hope.
